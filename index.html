					Hello, my name is Robert Ngo. I am currently a student at Cal Poly Pomona, about to finish my degree in Anthropology. I also work at an optometry as a lab technician. Dissatisfied with my current future prospects, I have begun to expand my knowledge and have thus began a new career path. I have learned very much about humans from all over and now I am learning all I can about computers, specifically web development. I am currently taking this bootcamp in the hopes of obtaining an interesting and fruitful career. I have always been a quick learner and now I am putting that ability to the test in this class.
